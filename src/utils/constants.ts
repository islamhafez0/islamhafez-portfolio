      "As a freelance Frontend Developer, I've had the chance to work on a variety of exciting projects—from building custom WordPress themes completely from scratch to developing advanced full-stack React applications. One of the projects I'm proudest of is a secure quiz app with OTP-protected access and session validation. I've also worked on e-commerce frontends, personal portfolios, and UI-heavy applications using tools like React.js, Next.js, and Firebase. Each project helped me grow—not just in technical skill, but also in understanding how to build clean, responsive, and user-centered interfaces that perform well and feel great to use. I enjoy translating ideas into real, usable products that clients and users love.",
