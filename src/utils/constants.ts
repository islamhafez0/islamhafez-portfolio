    description:
      "As a freelance Frontend Developer, I've had the chance to work on a variety of exciting projects—from building custom WordPress themes completely from scratch to developing advanced full-stack React applications. One of the projects I'm proudest of is a secure quiz app with OTP-protected access and session validation. I've also worked on e-commerce frontends, personal portfolios, and UI-heavy applications using tools like React.js, Next.js, and Firebase. Each project helped me grow—not just in technical skill, but also in understanding how to build clean, responsive, and user-centered interfaces that perform well and feel great to use. I enjoy translating ideas into real, usable products that clients and users love.",

I turn Figma designs into pixel-perfect Odoo themes, build fully custom websites, and continuously find creative solutions to improve our development flow. My role bridges the gap between frontend design and backend logic—ensuring everything fits naturally into the Odoo ecosystem while delivering a smooth user experience.",
